**Central** has everything configured to help you build websites on **GitHub** easily.
You can write your content using any code editor you like.
When you commit your code to your repository, **GitHub Pages** will build your website from the content of your files.

***

## Get started

1. Open your `_config.yml` file (or create one).
2. Remove existing values of `theme` and `remote_theme`.
3. Then set the following value.

```yml
remote_theme: nikahmadz/central
```
- Activate **GitHub Pages** to publish your website.


## Publishing your website

1. Go to **GitHub Pages Settings** of your repository:
    `//github.com/<user-name>/<repo-name>/settings/pages`
2. Scroll down to the **Source** section.
3. Choose the source of your website and hit **Save**.  eg: `main/(root)`

- Your app will be accessible at `//<user-name>.github.io/<repo-name>`.
